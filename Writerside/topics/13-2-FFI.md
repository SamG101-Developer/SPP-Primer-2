## Foreign Function Interface

S++ can interface will other language that create object or library files. Here are the steps involved to interface a
C++ library with S++:

1. **Create the C++ library:** Define the functions you want to expose to S++. They must be declared as `extern "C"` to
   prevent name mangling, so that the mapping between S++ and C++ function names is straightforward.
2. **Compile the C++ library:** The target output must be a shared object file (`.so` on Linux, `.dll` on
   Windows, `.dylib` on macOS). This will combine all the relevant object files into 1 library.
3. **Make the library accessible to S++:** Move the shared object into the `ffi/library_name` directory of your S++
   project. The name of the `library_name` folder must match the name of the shared object file.
4. **Create a stub file:** This file will contain the function signatures of the functions you want to call from S++,
   and the class definitions of any objects you want to create in S++. The stub file must be named `_stub.spp`, and must
   reside in the `ffi/library_name` directory
5. **Use the functions in S++:** Call the functions from S++ as if they were native functions. They will be namespaced
   under the standard 3rd party section, just as other `vcs` loaded modules would be: `use ext::library_name::*`.
   The `ext` namespace is reserved for external libraries, and the `library_name` namespace is the name of the shared
   object file.

### Example {collapsible="true"}

#### C++ Code
```c++
// example.cpp

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}


// other.cpp

class Example {
public:
    int a;
    int b;
    Example(int a, int b) : a(a), b(b) {}
    void set_a(int a) { this->a = a; }
}
```

#### Compile all files into a shared object file

```bash
g++ -shared -o example.so example.cpp other.cpp
mv example.so {ProjectPath}/ffi/example
```

#### S++ Stub Code
```
mod ffi::example::_stub

fun add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { }
fun subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { }

cls Example {
    a: i32
    b: i32
    fun set_a(a: i32) -> Void { }
}
```

#### S++ Code
```
use ext::example::*;

fun main() -> Void {
    let a = add(1_u32, 2_u32)
    let b = subtract(3_u32, 4_u32)
    let e = Example(1_u32, 2_u32)
}
```

## Conversions

S++ must make certain conversions when calling C++ functions. The following table shows the conversions that are made
when calling a C++ function from S++:

| C++ Type         | S++ Type | Notes                        |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------|
| `char`           | `I8`     | Identical types, no change   |
| `short`          | `I16`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `int`            | `I32`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `long`           | `I64`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `unsigned char`  | `U8`     | Identical types, no change   |
| `unsigned short` | `U16`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `unsigned int`   | `U32`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `unsigned long`  | `U64`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `float`          | `F32`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `double`         | `F64`    | Identical types, no change   |
| `bool`           | `Bool`   | Identical types, no change   |
| `void`           | `Void`   | Identical types, no change   |
| `T[]`            | `Arr[T]` | ?                            |
| `T*`             | `&mut T` | Only as a function parameter |
| `const T*`       | `&T`     | Only as a function parameter |

### Important notes
1. The other S++ primitives (`I128`, `I256`, `U128`, `U256`, `F8`, `F16`, `F128`, `F256`) do not have direct C++
   equivalents, and so cannot be used in FFI calls.
2. Not all features of every language will be supported. For example, C++ templates are not supported, and so cannot be
   used in FFI calls, until a template <-> generics conversion is implemented.
3. C++ constructors won't be called by S++ as object initialization is done in S++ itself. Again, as the system is
   further developed, this may change.
4. C++ functions returning pointers cannot be interfaced into S++, as S++ does not allow borrows as return values,
   enforcing second class borrows. Instead, arrays can be returned, and will be converted into the `Arr[T]` type.

## Safety

S++ does not have a concept of pointers, and so cannot directly access memory. This means that the FFI is inherently
safe, as it cannot cause memory corruption or leaks. However, the C++ functions can still cause undefined behaviour if
they are not written correctly.

As such, all FFI code, no matter the language, is executed in an isolated process, with every function call's return
value being wrapped in the result `Res[Pass, Fail]` type. This means that if the function call fails, then the error
will be propagated up the call stack, and the program will not crash.

Object initialization is done in S++ itself, and so the C++ constructors won't be called. This means that the object
creation will never fail, so there is no need to wrap the object creation in a `Res` type.

## Design Decisions

1. The reason for having **subfolders within the `ffi` folder** is that shared objects for different platforms can be
   placed in the same folder, and the correct one will be chosen at runtime. It also assists with dependency management.
2. The **name `_stub` was chosen** because it is a stub file, and prefixing with an underscore is both a common naming
   convention and will move the file to the top of the directory listing.
