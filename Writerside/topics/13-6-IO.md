## IO

S++ IO is split into 3 main parts:
- Console IO
- File IO
- Network IO

They all implement the same interface, so writing to a file at the lowest level can be changed to writing to the console
with minimal changes. Wrapper function names sit on top of the interface.

### Console IO

Console IO is the simplest form of IO. It is used to read and write to the console. The following functions are
available:
- `std::io::console::out` - Write to the console
- `std::io::console::err` - Write to the console error stream
- `std::io::console::in` - Read from the console

The top level wrapper functions are:
- `std::print` - Write to the console
- `std::eprint` - Write to the console error stream
- `std::read` - Read from the console
