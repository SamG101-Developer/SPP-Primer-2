# 5. Type System

<primary-label ref="header-label"/>

<secondary-label ref="doc-wip"/>

S++ has an advanced type system, using a strong-static type model. Generic, variadic, residual, function, tuple and
array types are supported, as well as union and intersection types. Flow typing can be used with union types for more
precise type checking. Type shorthands and type inference are also supported, and order of type declarations is not
important.
